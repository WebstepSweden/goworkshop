Welcome to the Go workshop. I'll try to take you through some of what I learned when
experimenting with this strange language and see if I can make you interested as well.

Most of what you'll find here is based on what I learned, mainly by solving exercises 
using the [Exercism](https://exercism.io) platform and by following the 
[Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) tutorial.

In order to avoid wasting time during the workshop, it is crucial that your development
environment is already set up before starting it, as it might take some time to set up 
individual environments, time which I'd rather spend on trying to show you what Go is all about.

So, ***please please please*** go through [these instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) 
to install Go and set up your environment, and make sure everything works as it should. 
Then, clone this repository to somewhere inside your go/src folder and open it using your 
favorite editor. Open the `try_me_first_test.go` file, and run the `TestIfThisWorks` test. 
If everything is working fine, you should see something like the following:
```
=== RUN   TestIfThisWorks
Everything is working just fine!
--- PASS: TestIfThisWorks (0.00s)
PASS
```

Voil√†! Now you're ready to start!
